Locking studies in a 2D heat conduction problem within an FE framework

Parameter dependent locking of finite element solutions is a well observed phenomenon. The code is aimed at evaluating various finite element formulations and their susceptibility to locking. A second order PDE which models the 2 dimensional heat conduction problem with orthotropic thermal conductivities is chosen for the study. The results shall then be correlated to the studies done by Babuska and Suri (May 1990).
